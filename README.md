# Cypress-Peripheral-Driver-Library-v3.0.1

##  Overview
Cypress Peripheral Driver Library (PDL) v3.0.1 is a software enablement product for the PSoC 6 device family that integrates:

- Device header files
- Startup code
- Peripheral drivers
- Middleware support

The platform and peripheral drivers abstract the hardware functions into a set of easy-to-use APIs. The integrated middleware provides high-level software solutions. The PDL is a Software Development Kit (SDK) for customers so that you can focus your efforts on application development to differentiate your own products, rather than spending energy creating a software development platform.

The PDL reduces the need to understand register usage and bit structures, thus easing software development for the extensive set of peripherals in the PSoC 6 families. You configure the library for the particular device, and then use API calls to initialize and use a peripheral. 

This version of the PDL supports CMSIS version 5.0.1.
